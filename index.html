    <h3>A little about me</h3>
    <p><span id="time"></span> I'm a developer who lives in <span class="highlight">Brooklyn</span>. I work at a company called <a href="http://newscred.com">NewsCred</a> where my job is to <span class="highlight">design software</span> for enterprise users. I play <span class="highlight">rugby</span>, which is featured on my <a href="instagram.com/ryanfs">instagram</a> account. (Instagram is an iPhone app that my friends and I use to post very similar pictures at the same time to see who can get the most likes and comments.)</p>

    <p>I <span class="highlight">write code</span> which you can see on my <a href="https://github.com/ryanfs">GitHub</a> account. I love side projects, send me a message on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/ryanfsal">LinkedIn</a> if you're interested in collaborating.

    <h3>A little about you...</h3>
    <p>Did you notice that time specific greeting up there? Well that's just the start. Using a little bit of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/">Javascript</a> I can sniff out things like the browser you're running <span class="highlight" id="showBrowser"></span> on a a <span class="highlight" id="cpu"></span>, your language setting (<span class="highlight" id="language"></span>), and the number of pages you've visited before this one (<span class="highlight">it's <span id="historyLength"></span></span>, and don't worry I can't actually see what the webpages were... that might be invasive to your privacy). </p>

    <p>I can even see the level your <span class="highlight">battery</span> is charged. You're at <span class="highlight"><span id="level"></span>% ðŸ”‹</span>. <span id="chargingTime"></span> precious minutes to go!</p>
    <p>This may come as no surprise, but I can know your exact location. Of course you'll have to grant me permission first, <a onclick="getLocation()">click here</a> to see your exact latitude and longitude. <p><span id="showLocation"></span></p>
    </p>
    <p>If you think this is creepy, that's because it is. Again, all of this information is being sent up by your computer and made available to anyone running a webpage using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/">Javascript Web API</a>.</p>
